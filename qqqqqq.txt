I am reaching out to request the necessary details for uploading files to your Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

Could you please provide the following information:

Project ID: The ID of the GCP project associated with the bucket.
Bucket Name: The name of the GCS bucket where the files will be uploaded.
Object Path/Name: Any specific naming conventions or paths required for the uploaded files.
Authentication: If needed, the service account JSON credentials to authenticate with the bucket.
Additionally, please let me know if there are any specific file size limits, formats, or other guidelines I should follow during the upload process.

Thank you for your assistance. Please feel free to share any additional information or steps that might be required.
